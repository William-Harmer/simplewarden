# SimpleWarden
> **Status:** Ongoing - project just started.

SimpleWarden combines [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) to ensure that email aliases stored on both platforms are always always synced across both services.

## Upcoming Features
- **Alias Syncing:** Automatically compare and sync email aliases between Bitwarden and SimpleLogin.
- **Alias Audit Report:** Generate a summary of missing, outdated, or mismatched aliases.
- **Two-Way Updates:** Option to update Bitwarden entries from SimpleLogin or vice versa.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Interact with SimpleWarden directly from the terminal for quick checks and sync operations.
- **Interactive Setup:** Guided setup to link your SimpleLogin and Bitwarden vault securely.
- **Logging & Reports:** Create local logs or export alias audit results for review.

More ideas and improvements will be added as development continues.
